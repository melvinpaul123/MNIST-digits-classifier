This repo. also contains the code for a GUI made using tkinter to classify the images. And another file wich can be used to use the webcan to detect the traffic signs. The data set for the project can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign Unzip the rar file before use before running the code download the following libraries: 1.Keras 2.Tensorflow 2.0 or greater 3.sklearn 4.OpenCV 5.matplotlib 6.numpy 7.tkinter
