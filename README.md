# MNIST-digits-classifier
This project utilizes keras and tensorflow to train a CNN model to classify images of 10 different digits, i.e 0-9 with relatively high accuracy. I achieved a 98% accuracy with this model.
Before running the code download the following libraries: 1.Keras 2.Tensorflow 2.0 or greater 3.sklearn 4.OpenCV 5.matplotlib 6.numpy
